Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

# Questions on the test

We are members of the engineering team of an online store. When we look at ratings for our online store application, we received the following
facts:
1. Customers were able to put items in their cart, check out, and then pay. After several days, many of our customers received calls from
our Customer Service department stating that their orders have been canceled due to stock unavailability.

My Answer:
"First, the goods must be ensured in a definite quantity"


2. These bad reviews generally come within a week after our 12.12 event, in which we held a large flash sale and set up other major
discounts to promote our store.
My Answer:
"After confirming the item data, make validation for the items that can still be ordered, before being paid,"


so that the data will not be able to be ordered to exceed the stock in the department
After checking in with our Customer Service and Order Processing departments, we received the following additional facts:
1. Our inventory quantities are often misreported, and some items even go as far as having a negative inventory quantity.
2. The misreported items are those that performed very well on our 12.12 event.
3. Because of these misreported inventory quantities, the Order Processing department was unable to fulfill a lot of orders, and thus
requested help from our Customer Service department to call our customers and notify them that we have had to cancel their orders.
My Answer:
"Here checking the goods must be confirmed manually, is it true that the goods are still available in the warehouse, before the goods will be marketed"
